# Lazer Blast

Having a blast playing with Lazer :D

## Installation

This project uses [jspm](http://jspm.io) for all its build and module goodness.
It's setup as a local dependency for npm, so just

* ``` npm install ```
* ``` jspm install ```
* ``` npm install -g live-server ``` (optional but how I do it)
* ``` live-server src ```

### Notes
ES2015 compiled on the fly using Babel (all handled by JSPM)
config.js modified to point the "lazer" package to the src folder in the repo
